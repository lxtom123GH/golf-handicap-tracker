## [2026-06-08] Security & Architecture Evaluation
**Status:** Audit Complete

### 👻 The Ghost (Root Causes)
A deep audit revealed severe state drift and proxy encapsulation failure. The core issue is that `AppState` only traps top-level assignments. Deep mutations (like `AppState.liveRoundGroups[x].scores[y] = 1`) completely bypass the `stateChange` dispatch, breaking reactivity. Additionally, extensive hardcoded visual overrides (`.classList.remove('hidden')`, `.style.display = 'none'`, `body.round-active`) completely subvert the `data-active-tab` protocol.

### 🛡️ The Silver Bullet (Recommendations)
1. **Deep Proxy Restructuring:** The state manager requires recursive proxying or explicit immutable top-level reassignment arrays to force event dispatching on deep object changes.
2. **DOM Visibility Migration:** Remove all explicit class list `.hidden` toggles and replace them with state-mapped data attributes.
